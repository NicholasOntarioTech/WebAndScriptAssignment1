(1) what dimensions did you use for each view port and why?
    Phone Width: 0px - 480px
    Tablet Width: 481px - 960px
    Computer Width: 981px +
    I chose these dimensions for the viewports because, in the lecture notes, these were given as 
    the standard viewport dimensions for the given devices. Not sure what more to explain.

(2) Where did you use linear AND angle gradient?
    I used a linear gradient on the header and footer, which gives a subtle pop to those elements. 
    I used an angular gradient on the padding of the video element on the about me page. Also, I 
    used a radial gradient when hovering over the nav buttons, which makes it clear to see that
    you are about to click the button. These gradients are visible in all viewport sizes.

(3)which color scheme did you use and why?
    For the computer and tablet viewport, I chose a very natural color scheme, featuring two 
    shades of dark, rich greens ( #395144 , #587a5a ), a cream color ( #EEE9CC ), brown 
    ( #8B7147 ) and dark grey ( #393939 )for a neutral background. I ran these colors through 
    an accessibility checker, and the only flag was for any combination with the brown color. For 
    that reason, on mobile devices the brown was changed for a higher-contrasting brown ( #81642c )
    I found this color scheme by browsing natural looking color schemes on adobe.

NOTICE! USE OF EXTERNAL CODE: Line 43 in "contact.html" was taken from 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/tel . I use this line of 
code because I was unsure how to verify that the phone number field was a valid phone number. This is 
the only line of code that I took from a source outside of the lecture material. It works by only 
allowing the input to consist of 3 digits followed by a dash, then three more digits followed by a 
dash, and finally 4 more digits, therefore the input must take the form of a phone number.

Although I didn't do the math, I believe that this line consists of less than 10% of my total code.
