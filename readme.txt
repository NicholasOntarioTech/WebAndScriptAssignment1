(1) what dimensions did you use for each view port and why?
    Phone: Width 0px - 480px
    Tablet: Width: 481px - 960px
    Computer: 981px +
    I chose these dimensions for the viewports because, in the lecture notes, these were given as 
    the standard viewport dimensions for the given devices

(2) Where did you use linear AND angle gradient?
    I used a linear gradient on the header and footer, which gives a nice pop to those elements. 
    I used an angular gradient on the padding of the video element on the about me page. Also, I 
    used a radial gradient when hovering over the nav buttons

(3)which color scheme did you use and why?
    For the computer and tablet viewport, I chose a very natural color scheme, featuring two 
    shades of dark, rich greens ( #395144 , #587a5a ), a cream color ( #EEE9CC ), brown 
    ( #8B7147 ) and dark grey ( #393939 )for a neutral background. I ran these colors through 
    an accessibility checker, and the only flag was for any combination with the brown color. For 
    that reason, on mobile devices the brown was changed for a higher-contrasting brown ( #81642c )
